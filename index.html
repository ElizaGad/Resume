    <h2>Summary</h2> 
    <p>I’m a UX/UI designer with logistic background. At the the beginning of 2021 I’ve decided to leave transport industry and use my inner need to discover and understand the way humans act and interact. <br />
        I took a bootcamp course to develop as a UX/UI designer. During the course I have become passionated about functional interfaces and ability to create meaningful and relevant experiences to users. <br />
        Having an open mind helps me to understand user problems and find a way to solve them. Changing career path made me run my passion into profession.</p>
